<!-- 
the tablinks variable takes in the 3 <p> elements from when the class name has "tab-links" in it.
the tabcontents variable has the 3 <div> elements from when the class name has "tab-contents" in it.

the function opentab takes in the tabname 'skills', 'experience', or 'education' depending on which tab user clicks.
the for loop goes through all 3 <p> elements to remove the "active-link" part of the class name.
the second for loop goes through all 3 <div> elements to remove the "active-tab" part of the class name.
now, based on the event that's running, 
    currentTarget takes the element of that event, 
    classList gets us the name of the class for that element
    "active-link" gets added to the class name.
lastly, getElementById gets the <div> element associated with the tabname ID and adds "active-tab" to it.
    from here, CSS gives the class w/ "active-link" a 50% width rectange and displays the contents of the class w/ "active-tab"

                    <br>
                    <p>Overview: I designed and manufactured a clickable pen out of brass as an instructable project for the Texas Inventionworks [TIW] Machine Shop.
                        An instructable is a project that student staff at TIW can create along with instructions for interested students to build for themselves.
                        Once all documentation has been created, projects are then added to the display case for students to observe along with QR codes linked to the instructions.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The instructable for this project is linked <a href="https://www.instructables.com/TIW-Clickable-Brass-Pen">here.</a><br>
                        <br>
                        Since I created this from scratch, it required several iterations during the design process to ensure a reliable clicking mechanism.
                        The final CAD was designed in SolidWorks and the drawing sheets are linked <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dWUasaUazbKOP9U-Iio5Rd7OLEZiPNA8/view?usp=sharing">here.</a><br>

                    <br>
                    <p>Overview: I designed, soldered, and coded a macropad as a keyboard extension for my computer.
                        I modeled the casing in SolidWorks and printed it using a Bambu P1P in PLA, and the keypads were modeled in OnShape and printed in PETG.
                        The plate holding the adafruit tactile keys was laser cut out of acrylic using a Trotec Laser Cutter.
                        I soldered the wires connecting the keys in a matrix formation and soldered them to a Raspberry Pi.
                        All coding was done in Python and uploaded via USB to the Raspberry Pi.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The drawing sheet for the casing is linked <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RlSVDW68iFiJ6ce7nSMBQhIxWkgvK9yn/view?usp=sharing">here.</a>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The macropad keys shown in the attached picture are emojis, hence the name "Moji Mac."
                        However, the design is modular and can be switched with numeric keypads.
                        I used the numerical keypad configuration for my accounting class as a part of my Business Foundations Minor and will continue to use this for future Business and Engineering classes.
                        This project served as a demonstration of using the skills I've gained in 3D CAD and electronics to create a functional assembly.

                    <br>
                    <p>Overview: Texas Flight is UT Austin's Design, Build, Fly [DBF] team that competes in AIAA's international RC plane competition.
                        As a member of the structures team on Texas Flight starting in August 2024, I worked with a team of 10 in performing composite wet layups for the fuselage and landing gear.
                        Additionally, I prototyped a nose gear for the plane to bear its nearly 50lb weight during mission 3 with payload. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        We placed 6th internationally out of 112 teams in April of last year, putting us in the top 5%.
                        This year, I am serving as the Structures Co-Lead leading a team of 15 in manufacturing the fuselage, landing gear, and nose gear of the plane.
                        As the structures co-lead, I work with the Chief Engineer and CAD lead to design a plane that not just meets competition guidelines but scores exceptionally in all 3 missions.
                        Additionally, I prototyped the nose gear of the plane with a suspension system to alleviate high landing forces.

                    <h2> Undergraduate Research </h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>Overview: Working with a team of 5 under my Thermodynamics Professor Dr. Matthew Hall, I have worked on two research projects.
                        For our first project, we were tasked with determining the most efficient running conditions of the UT Engine Group's single-cylinder gasoline engine.
                        Using a National Instruments LabView program, we modified the spark timing, dwell time, air-fuel ratio, fuel injection timing and duration, and the mean effective pressure.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Throughout the research process, we dealt with several issues including the spark plug firing on the wrong edge of the engine stroke, LabView connection failures, the flywheel falling out of callibration, and engine knocking.
                        Equipped with a stroboscopic light, digital osciloscope, encoders, a manometer, and pressure transducer, we were able to troubleshoot these problems using root cause analysis methods.
                        For our first experiment, we changed the duration of the fuel injection, ultimately varying the air-fuel ratio.
                        In our second experiment, we changed the spark control timing using a sweep procedure. 
                        Ultimately, we presented our findings at FIRE's annual conference to a group of researchers and engineering professors. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Currently, I am engaged in a research project where we are analyzing the current breakdown event of spark plugs under pressurized conditions
                        to determine degradation mitigation strategies.
                        This project is aiding an ongoing research project led by Gabriel Brito under Dr. Matthew Hall.

                    <h2> Wired Earbuds Case </h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>Overview: This project came to fruition out of frustration with my wired earbuds.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    Unsatisfied with every wired earbud case on the market and annoyed with my constantly tangled wired earbuds, I decided to make one.
                    Modeling the case entirely in SolidWorks and going through 4 different iterations, I eventually landed on this - a wired earbud case that also serves as a fidget spinner.
                    This project tested my ability to work around design challenges such as dimensioning, ease of use, and manufacturability.

                    <h2> Aluminum Ball in Cube </h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>Overview: This project tested my ability to tolerance, CAM, effectively follow set-up procedures, and learn to CNC mill.
                        My tools for this project included Fusion and the PNC Tormach 1100.
                        I learned to export NC programs, use soft-jaws, and explore different smoothening operations to achieve the ball in cube.

<!-- 
the work_imgs variable takes in the 6 <div> elements from when the class name has "work" in it.
the work_descs variable has the 6 <div> elements from when the class name has "desc" in it.

the function openwork takes in the work id 'pen', 'macropad', 'plane', 'engine', 'earbuds', or 'cnc' depending on which work user clicks.
the first for loop goes through all 6 work <div> elements to remove the "active-work" part of the class name.
the second for loop goes through all 6 desc <div> elements to remove the "active-desc" part of the class name.
now, based on the event that's running, 
    currentTarget takes the element of that event, 
    classList gets us the name of the class for that element
    "active-work" gets added to the class name.
lastly, getElementById gets the <div> element associated with the desc ID and adds "active-desc" to it.
    from here, CSS gives the class w/ "active-work" a 100% height layer and displays the contents of the class w/ "active-desc"
